# weixin.next
Weixin(wechat) libraries for .net

## target
Simple, easy to use, evolves with weixin itself. Official docs included in repository, easier to track the diffs.

.Net 4.5+ only, uses HttpClient, async/await a lot.

Completeness is not a priority, features needed by myself will be implement first.

## next steps

1. menu api
2. user api
3. messagging api
4. account api
5. weixin js api
6. other stuff
